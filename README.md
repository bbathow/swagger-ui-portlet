# Swagger UI Portlet

This app integrates the [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) into Liferay portal.

This allows for easy testing and display of deployed swagger files that can be present in other bundles.

Due to the character of the swagger standalone js libraries this portlet requires the **JavaScript Loader** to be globally hidden. 

This can be set in Control panel -> System settings -> JavaScript Loader.

The portlet can be used in a standard portlet page or as a full page application.
